# Frontend Developer Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge for prospective frontend developer applicants applying through http://work.traderev.com/

## Goal:

#### Build simple app that allows viewing and interacting with a grid of curated photos from Unsplash

- [ ] Fork this repo. Keep it public until we have been able to review it.
- [ ] Use your favourite framework: React, Angular, Vue, Express, Rails, etc
- [ ] Unsplash API docs are here: https://unsplash.com/documentation.
- [ ] Grid of photos should preserve the aspect ratio of the photos it's displaying, meaning you shouldn't crop the image in any way.
- [ ] Design should be responsive to work in desktop and mobile
- [ ] Grid should work in both portrait and landscape orientations of the device.
- [ ] Grid should support pagination
- [ ] When user taps on a photo on the grid it should show the photo in full screen with more information about the photo.
- [ ] Full screen mode should show arrows on the left and right edges of the photo when user moves the mouse or touches the screen.
- [ ] When the user clicks on arrow on the left, it should set focus on the previous photo.
- [ ] When the user clicks the arrow on the right, it should set focus to the next photo.
- [ ] When the full screen is dismissed, user should go back to the grid view. Also the photo that was in the full screen view must be in the gridview.

### Evaluation:
- [ ] Provide a README to run/build the project to view in a browser
- [ ] No crashes, bugs, compiler warnings
- [ ] App operates as intended
- [ ] Has clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Code is easily understood and communicative
- [ ] Commit history is consistent, easy to follow and understand
